Having the project plan defined, please create information architecture for the app.

It should be simple yet engaging project that we can build and run locally.

Please provide a list of pages and components that you think are necessary for the MVP.

The information architecture should be based on the API that we've discovered in the previous step.

Focus on core functionality - features such as authentication, user management, etc. should be excluded.

You may want to use storage based on local storage or JSON files.
