- Check if all the imports point to existing files. If not, implement the missing parts.

- Verify component cross-references - if files are missing and needed, add them.
- Check if information architecture matches the requirements. If not, change the architecture.
- Check if the API is properly utilized. If not, you are free to change business logic.
