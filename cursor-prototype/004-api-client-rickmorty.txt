Having the project plan defined, please build backend client that will be used to fetch data from the Rick and MortyAPI.

Do not use any external libraries for data fetching.

If you are implementing any Astro functions, please make sure that they are uppercased.

Backend layer may include business logic and more complex endpoints that will allow you to execute the project plan.
