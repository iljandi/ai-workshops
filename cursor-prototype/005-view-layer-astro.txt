Please implement view layer for the app that will be based on the project plan and available API client.

Focus on server-side pages and layouts in Astro. Do not implement any client-side components yet. Main navigation from the information architecture should be implemented.

Stick to the tech stack defined in the .cursorrules file.

As a result, I would like to navigate through all the pages in my browser.
